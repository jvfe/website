I’m a Bachelor in Biomedical Science and currently a Master of Science student in Bioinformatics. I’m experienced with software development in Python and R, particularly in what pertains to scientific software and data analysis.

My current role, apart from being a MSc student, is working on developing Nextflow pipelines (in particular [ARETE](https://github.com/beiko-lab/arete/)) for the Beiko Lab at Dalhousie University, Canada.

I'm currently interested in: Metagenomics, Open Data, FOSS culture, generative art and reproducible science.
